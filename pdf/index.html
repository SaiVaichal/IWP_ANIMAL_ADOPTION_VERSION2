  <h1>Life is better with a furry friend.</h1>
  <p>We have hundreds of animals waiting eagerly to find their forever homes. Many of them have been rescued from the streets and each of them is deserving of a loving, caring family they can call their own. </p>
  <p>It’s a lot easier to adopt than you think. We promise. And we’re here to guide you every step of the way. </p>

  <h3>Adoption is a commitment</h3>
  <p>Adopting an animal is not a decision to take lightly. Cats and dogs can live as long as 15 years.</p>
  <p>We want to ensure that our animals go to people who will provide them with a clean, safe, family environment, will feed them properly, take care of them when they are sick, and will – above all – love them long time. </p>

  <h3>Choosing the right pet</h3>
      <div class="goa" style="width:700px;margin-top: 10px;background-color: #FEFBF6;">
        
        <p>Before you decide to adopt, we recommend you consider a few factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have lots of time to entertain an energetic animal or are you looking for an older, calmer pet?</li>
          <li>Do you have an outdoor space that your pet can explore safely? Or would you prefer an animal that’s comfortable spending time indoors?</li>
          <li>Do you already have a pet? If yes, what kind of temperament does your existing pet have?</li>
          <p>If you already have a pet, please bring them with you when you come to the shelter. Photos of your help will help us advise you on who from our animal family will be a good fit for you.  </p>
