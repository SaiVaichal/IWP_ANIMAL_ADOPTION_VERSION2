    <h3>As sweet as she is sassy, Goli is a charming girl who needs a family to call her own.</h3>
    <p>Aptly named Goli (Hindi for bullet), she loves nothing more than to zoom about as fast as she can at every opportunity!  </p>

        <p> Having been orphaned as a young pup with a nasty tail wound which required amputation, Goli has spent most of her life here with us at Animal Aid just hoping for a perfect home. She can be a little reserved with newcomers, but once youâ€™ve earned her trust her curiosity knows no bounds and she will gladly greet you with a wag of her stumpy tail and a gentle nudge for affection.  </p>
        
            <p> She is extremely playful with other dogs and with people, and her favourite pastimes are playing tug of war or chasing a ball. After playing, her next favourite pastime is eating and she will do anything for a piece of biscuit. Once her energy is spent, she also enjoys snuggling or sunbathing in a cosy spot in the sun. Goli would love a family with another dog for companionship and to match her energy levels.
